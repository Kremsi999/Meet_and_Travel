git 'command' --help //documentation for 'command'


git rm --cached <file> //unstages the file completely and the new commit won't have the file, but it will remain in your local directory

git reset (HEAD) <file> //(removes from the staging area for the next commit) unstages any modifications mades since the last commit (but doesn't revert them in the filesystem)
git reset HEAD * //unstages all files in staging area
git reset HEAD~1 //undo last commit
git reset --hard // reverts everything to the latest commit (modifies even the local copy to match the previous commit)

git push -f // if you want to force your branch to remote (used to revert commits without trace on remote, tijana dont use this.)

git restore <file> <==> git checkout -- <file> //discard changes

git revert commit //it reverts to the given commit by creating a new commit that has the same state as the commit given
git revert HEAD~1 //same as above, but relatively

git clean -fd //removes untracked files and directories (like deleting them)


git pull --all // it's the same as git fetch --all + merge current branch



git diff branch1..branch2 // difference between 2 branches
git diff // difference between last commit and now

git merge -X theirs branch //uses the recursive strategy to merge branches and in case of conflicts it uses 'their' branch 


git merge --no-ff branch// this is what we want 99% of the time!

sync with master full command:
git checkout master && git pull && git checkout my_branch && git pull && git merge -X theirs --no-ff master

First, press the Esc key a few times. This will ensure vi is out of Insert mode and in Command mode.
Second, type :q! and press Enter. This tells vi to quit without saving any changes. (If you do want to save your changes, type :wq instead.)



git fetch origin pull/ID/head:BRANCHNAME //checkout pull request localy on a new branched called BRANCHNAME

git checkout commit file // checkout the file in the specified commit 

git stash save "comment" // the idea of a commit, but not commiting it. You 'stash' your current state and you can restore it at wish. Mostly used to save your current work before checking out a different branch/commit when you don't want to commit your current work.
git stash list //name says it all 
git stash apply stash@{id} // restores the stash (it doesn't change the position of HEAD - you can still be in detach HEAD state) - checkout the commit/branch you stashed and then restore the stash
git stash pop // restores the stash and removes it from the list of stashes (applies the stash and drops it). It always pops the latest (like a stack) and the newest stash has ID=0
git stash drop 'stash@{id}' //drops the given stash
git stash clear //deletes all stashes

!TIP: stashes from one branch can be applied to other branches! Maybe this is a better way to sinck with master?
/*
-master is up to date
git stash save "master.."
git checkout branch
git apply stash
git add . 
git commit -m "merged with master"
(git push)
-the last branch can do a git stash pop instead of apply
-this should be tested first - It doesn't work because it only saves changest and not the whole state so when master is up to date stashing it doesn't save anything because it's already commited
*/

git reflog // shows history? Shows even lost commits that are commited to detached HEAD state
git branch <name> commit //create a new branch from the given commit 


//VERY USEFUL WHEN MULTIPLE PEOPLE ARE UPDATING A FEW FILES AND YOU WANT TO TEST THEM WITHOUT MERGEING!!!!

# Check out "somefile.c" from branch `my_branch`
git checkout my_branch -- somefile.c

# Check out these 4 files from `my_branch`
git checkout my_branch -- file1.h file1.cpp mydir/file2.h mydir/file2.cpp

# Check out ALL files from my_branch which are in
# directory "path/to/dir"
git checkout my_branch -- path/to/dir
